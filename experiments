Fisrtly, I tried the north_b and east_b of wumpus_02 together but get the same output
and get the solution a=<1,4> w0=<2,3> p0=<3,1> p1=<3,2>

Then I add the constrain that a and the action must keep sync
con a z
So, the north_b and east_b of wumpus_02 is separated

The answer with a.csp & b.csp have the influence below with the dao[action] property
    safe        unsafe     trivial      invalid      unknown
a   no_sol      has_sol    no_sol       no_sol       has_sol
b   has_sol     no_sol     has_sol      has_sol      has_sol

I set the con a z that, z has the only domain if there is no solution
con a z : <x,y> <0,0>
and make a and z the same to represent no solution
